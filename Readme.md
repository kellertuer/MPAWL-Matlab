# MPAWL for MatLab =
This `MatLab` Library is an implementation of the periodic Wavelet Transform based on an integral regular matrix __M__ and its factorization into dilation matrices. Introducing the multivariate de la Vall√©e Poussin means, this Library provides many scaling functions for the levels of decomposition. This package  was transcribed from the Mathematica version, which is available at [https://github.com/kellertuer/MPAWL](https://github.com/kellertuer/MPAWL)

The underlying theory of patterns, its generating groups and the fast Fourier transform on these patterns is also implemented in this Library yielding a fast Wavelet Transform, when computing in Fourier coefficients. Further, several functions to work with the translates of a function with respect to the pattern

For the dyadic case, i.e. |det __J__<sub>k</sub>|=2 for all factor matrices, this Library also provides the construction of corresponding wavelets and an algorithm to decompose on several different factorizations at the same time.

Further, for the dyadic two-dimensional case, several visualization methods are given for the pattern, the wavelet and scaling functions and the obtained fractions of a function sampled on a pattern and decomposed with respect to the wavelets.
